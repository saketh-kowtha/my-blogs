I created a mini web app it will convert time and date from one time zone to other time zone.

Here is the link:
https://time-zone-converter.vercel.app/

For Source code or API docs please visit https://github.com/saketh-kowtha/time-zone-converter

Please visit and give your feedback or any improvements and suggestions if any

Cheers!
