Gatsby is react based **open source** framework to create static websites and static web-apps. It is suitable if we are building portfolio sites or blogs or company home pages.

### Why Gatsby ?

1. It will build static sites that are **P**rogressive **W**eb **A**pps .
2. It will follow the latest **Web standards.**
3. Eco system.
4. Gatsby sites are optimised and highly performant.
5. It will allow us to work with ReactJs, Webpack, GraphQL, ES6+, Js, Css and CSS-in-JS.

I would like to add one more point i.e Building static sites with `react` is not easy. Because if we take `create-react-app` as an example it will focus more on **S**ingle **P**age **A**pps but for Routing, Seo, Performance and Optimisation we need to do lot of configuration which gatsby provide as default in starter's.

### Gatsby features

1. **Supports Reactjs**

   which will help us to build reusable components and make things easier to maintain.

2. **Webpack**

   which will help to create minified and optimised bundles.

3. **SCSS and CSS-in-JS**

   It has support for SCSS, CSS-in-JavaScript libraries, allow us to manage styles better.

4. **Responsive images**

   Resizing images based on devices.

5. **600+ Gatsby plugins**

   There are lot of gatsby plugins available for `responsive-images`, `data sources`, `offline support`, `Mdx` and `analytics` etc...

6. **Supports react and npm packages**

   We can install any `npm` package and can use it in the app.

7. **GraphQL**

   Gatsby collects data from data sources and make it available via GraphQL. The data sources could be any thing `databases` or ` json` or `XML` or `wordpress` or `text files` etc..

8. **Gives Smoother experience to user**

   Gatsby will add smoothness to the app with its features and aims at full app like experience borrowing from PWA.
